Add modifier param to Midi note. (to be used for
selecting which sample to play, where to hit drum etc).


Add pre-play.  Probably done by extending adding a midi call.
 -- This call would be processed like a midi note. 

Add A-B suppoer to settings somehow.

Allow the reading of a timing map which the seq will
instead of a the tempo for working out where the
notes go.
  pattern has note_len (different from notelen which holds
  the tempo).  note_len is fine to be used for working out
  cadences, but the note position is based on 'location'.
  note_len is added to that.  A timing map could present an
  a method called next_location( current_loc, number notes ).
  then that would be called with the note length (in notes)
