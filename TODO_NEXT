Add pre-play.  Probably done by extending adding a midi call.

 -- This call would be processed like a midi note. 

Work out out how to manage patches for the devices.
-- Idea of a Project?  Holds the configuration.  It this specified in
   a .seq?  Does the project point to a .seq?  I dont think so.

   Basically a script interface for IManage.

Stuff to do  sometime:

fix quotess in Reader.
