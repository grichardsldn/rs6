Create a recorder device.

Add pre-play.  Probably done by extending adding a midi call.

 -- This call would be processed like a midi note. 

Work out out how to manage patches for the devices.

   a .seq?  Does the project point to a .seq?  I dont think so.

   Basically a script interface for IManage.

Put code in empty recorder device.

Stuff to do  sometime:
